# Quizlet-Writer

Quizlet Writer had to interact with quizlet.com website and create quizes by getting words from the users and then finding the matching definitions on the website. Since Quizlet does not have an API (as of 2021), Selenium Webdriver was used for that purpose. However, the project is unfinished as of today and cannot be fully tested due to some bug.
